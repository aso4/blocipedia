# Blocipedia

A SaaS app that allows users to create public and private wikis, upgrade a user from standard to premium through a payment system, and add and remove collaborators (other users) to and from private wikis. The wikis support markdown.

The application runs on Ruby 2.3.0 and Rails 5.0.0.1. Please view the gemfile for application dependencies. The application uses SQLite for development and testing databases and Postgres for production. View the application in action at https://powerful-brushlands-47458.herokuapp.com
